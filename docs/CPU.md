## Pinout

| Pin # | Name | Description |
|-|-|-|
| 0-15 | IO0-15 | **Address/Data Parallel Bus:** These lines contain the time-multiplexed address (T<sub>1</sub>, T<sub>2</sub>)<br>and data (T<sub>W</sub>, T<sub>4</sub>) buses. During the T<sub>1</sub> cycle, bits A<sub>0</sub>-A<sub>7</sub> of the address bus is outputted.<br>Bit A<sub>0</sub> is the BLE# signal. It is LOW during T<sub>1</sub> if only the low 8-bits is to be transferred<br>during memory or I/O operations. |
| 16 | ALE0 | **Address Latch Enable (LOW):** HIGH during T<sub>1</sub> to signal for the latching of the low 8-bits<br>of the address signal. It is LOW otherwise. |
| 17 | ALE1 | **Address Latch Enable (HIGH):** HIGH during T<sub>2</sub> to signal for the latching of the high 8-bits<br>of the address signal. It is LOW otherwise. |
| 18 | WE# | **Write Enable:** Write strobe is LOW during T<sub>W</sub> to indicate that the processor is performing<br>an I/O or memory write operation. |
| 19 | OE# | **Output Enable:** When LOW, indicates that the processor IO lines are ready<br>to accept/output data. It is held HIGH during T<sub>1</sub> and T<sub>2</sub>. |
| 20 | BHE# | **Bus High Enable:** When LOW, signals for the high 8-bits to be transferred<br>during memory or I/O operations. |
| 22 | PIO | **IO Mode:** When HIGH, indicates that the current operation is an I/O, not memory, operation.<br>This results in the omittance of cycle T<sub>2</sub>. |
| 23, 24 | RX, TX | 9600 Baud UART Interface |
| 25-... | GPIO0-... | General Purpose Input/Output |

**Notes:**
- By adding an extra ALE3 (24-bit address bus) and/or ALE4 (32-bit address bus), 8 more bits can be saved from the IO pins
- The PIO pin is no-connect and is there for the possibility of peripheral interfaces
- If IRQ signals are required, each GPIO signal should generate an interrupt
- GPIO pins are all digital without PWM support. ADCs and IO expansions can be attached later to this or to the IO/data bus with the help of the PIO pin. Someone just has to work out the timing waveforms.

**Recommended Chips:**
- CY62147G variant for 4M (512x16) SRAM (55ns rw cycle)
- 74xx573 for address latches (as fast as 1ns tpd)
- 74xx245 for tristate bus buffers if needed
- Some I2C/SPI GPIO expansion
- Some ADC for analogue input (I'm not sure what to use)

## Timing Waveforms

Various timing diagrams of the address and data buses

### Read Cycle

Clock Cycles: 4 minimum

Timing Requirements:
- The duration of the T<sub>W</sub> read clock (no data input) is determined by the `tpd` of whichever memory chip used.
- T<sub>W</sub> can span multiple clock periods to allow for different memory timings. This will allow the CPU to be clocked at a higher speed than the memory chips.

In the implementation, OE# is the AND of 2 signals, one leading edge and one falling edge-driven signals.
