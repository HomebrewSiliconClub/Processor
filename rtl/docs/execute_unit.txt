0       we_a (we for MAR from obus)
1       we_w (we for DTW from obus)
2       we_b (we for new PC into branch unit)
3       oe_d (oe for DTR onto ibus)
4       oe_p (oe for PC onto ibus)
5       oe_i (oe for IMM onto ibus)
6       oe_r (oe for REGFILE onto ibus)

11:13   ALU T1
14:16   ALU T2
18:19   RSEL READ T1 (select rd, rm, rn)
20:21   RSEL READ T2 (select rd, rm, rn)
22      RSEL WRITE (whether rd will be written to)
some memory stuff...
how to tell xu the clock cycles...

Note about registers:
- Rm, Rn are always read from
- Rd may be written to
- Rd may also be read from

Examples:

MOV Rd, imm16
T1: put imm16 onto ibus, set alu to MOV, select Rd to write to
W2-1-a1-a2-b--ripdbwa
100000000000000100000

LDR Rd, [Rm+sh(Rn)]



STR Rd, [Rm+sh(Rn)], Rd
